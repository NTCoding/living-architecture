# Step 1: Understand the Codebase

Analyze your codebase to understand its structure, conventions, and domain boundaries.

::: tip Future Enhancement
This step currently uses AI-assisted analysis. Deterministic tooling for codebase analysis is planned for a future release.

## Instructions

Follow the AI-assisted workflow for this step:

**[Step 1: Understand →](/extract/steps/step-1-understand)**

## Output

Creates `.riviere/config/metadata.md` containing:
- Codebase structure (source folders, test folders)
- Domain boundaries and types
- Framework detection
- Naming conventions
- Entry points (API routes, event handlers, UI pages)

## Next Step

After completing codebase analysis, proceed to:
