## The Problem

Modern distributed systems span multiple codebases, languages, and domains. Understanding how an operation flows through the system is difficult:

- **Static documentation** becomes outdated immediately
- **Dependency graphs** show imports, not operational flow
- **Manual diagramming** is time-consuming and error-prone
- **Cross-codebase tracing** requires tribal knowledge

## The Solution

Rivière extracts **flow-based architecture** directly from code. Instead of showing technical dependencies, it traces how operations flow through your system.

```text
UI /orders
  → API /bff/orders/place
  → UseCase: Place Order
  → DomainOp: Order.begin()
  → Event: order-placed
  → EventHandler: Prepare Shipping
```
